    '''Function to calculate the threshold values for cloud pixels in each vertical profile of the density field.
    
    This function represents the synthesis of methods A and B in the ATL04/09 ATBD part 2 [https://doi.org/10.5067/48PJ5OUJOP4C]. The default arguments are for method B (although the bias and sensitivity values likely need changing for MPL data)

    INPUTS:
        density : np.ndarray
            nxm numpy array containing the density field data.

        data_mask : None, np.ndarray (dtype=boolean)
            nxm numpy array containing the locations of the invalid data points. If None, then no special handling of the NaN values will be performed for the quantile calculation.

        downsample : int
            The number of bins (squared) to downsample the input data by. The downsampling takes the maximum value within a (dxd) square to use in the quantile caluclation. Here, d = 2*downsample+1 to ensure the max value is centered on the correct pixel. A value of 0 performs no downsampling.

        segment_length : int
            The number of vertical profiles (after downsampling) to consider in the moving window for the quantile calculation. The number will be 2*segment_length+1, to ensure that the measurement is always centered on the correct profile.

        bias : float
            The offset bia used in calculating the threshold.

        sensitivity : float
            The linear coefficient that multiplies the quantile value in the threshold calculation.

        quantile : float
            Value between 0 and 100 (in %), the quantile value that is to be used in the threshold calculation.

        verbose : bool
            Flag for printing out debug statements

        kwargs : additional arguments won't be used.

    OUTPUTS:
        thresholds : np.ndarray
            (n,1) numpy array containing the threshold value for clouds in each vertical profile in data.
